# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Overview:
The project centers on analyzing the Canadian Housing Market and offering insights into its trends over the last four decades.
Available dataset: Housing Price Index,Consumer Index, Office Reale State Index, Real Estate numbers, Real Estate Prices

Goal:
1. Explore six different datasets
2. Observe trends and patterns
3. Provide visualization to the questions 

## Process
1. Review Files: Review each file provided to understand the data structure, variables, and contents.
2. JSON to CSV Conversion (weekly_earnings.ipynb): Use a Jupyter Notebook (weekly_earnings.ipynb) to parse through the weekly_earnings.json file and convert it into a CSV format. This step is necessary as Tableau is more adept at handling data in CSV format.
3. Import Data into Tableau: Import each of the data sets (including the CSV file created in step 2) as data sources into Tableau.
4. Data Types Formatting: Format the data types in Tableau to ensure proper categorization and analytical functionality, especially data format.
5. Data Linking: Establish connections between the data sets. The housing price index table is chosen as the primary table for linking.
6. Visualization Creation: Create visualizations on separate sheets for each question being asked. Utilize appropriate charts, graphs, and visual elements.
7. Additional Features: Incorporate calculated fields, parameters, filters (both static and interactive), animations, etc., as required for each visualization to enhance analytical capabilities.
8. Dashboard Design: Combine the visualizations, filters, and other elements on dashboards. Create one dashboard per question to ensure clarity and relevance.
9. Story Creation: Combine all dashboards into a single story within Tableau. Ensure a logical flow of information and insights.
10. Review and Refinement: Review the overall analysis, visualizations, and story. Make refinements as needed to improve clarity and effectiveness.
